# Cardpass

Cardpass is an iOS app that enables you to handle all your passwords but instead of saving them on a database, we 
use an NFC Tag to save it. 

### Main features:

- Encryption for all the information.
- Once you save your first password, only your device can read all of them.
- You decide which NFC Tag you want to choose.
- We don't store any information about you or your passwords.
- The only accessible ways to access to your password is with your phone and your card. 

### Future implementations:

- Autocomplete in browsers.
- Android build.
